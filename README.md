INTRODUCTION

In the evolving field of science, the analysis of time series data stands as a cornerstone for understanding dynamic ecological processes. This project aims to utilize time series analysis techniques, as taught in an Applied Stochastic Processes part III class, to explore real-world ecological data. Specifically, the focus is on employing these methods to analyze a freely available dataset, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which serves as a proxy for assessing vegetation health over time. The NDVI dataset offers a unique opportunity to apply theoretical concepts learned in class to practical, real-life environmental data, bridging the gap between academic learning and applied research. By leveraging time series analysis, this study seeks to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the NDVI data, providing insights into the underlying ecological phenomena influencing vegetation health.

PROBLEMM STATEMENT

This study aims to apply and critically understand the methodologies taught in Applied Stochastic Process through a practical case study involving the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset. The NDVI is a widely used remote sensing measure that indicates the presence and condition of vegetation on the Earth's surface, making it is a valuable dataset for examining temporal and spatial variations in vegetation health and coverage. Despite the practical significance of accurately modeling NDVI data for environmental monitoring and agricultural forecasting, the primary objective of this research is not to develop the most accurate predictive models for NDVI values. Instead, the focus is on implementing various time series analysis techniques—including ARIMA, SARIMA, SES, and MA models—to explore how these methods can be applied to real-world data, understand the underlying assumptions and limitations of each model, and interpret the results in the context of vegetation dynamics. Through this application-oriented approach, this study seeks to deepen the understanding of time series modeling concepts, enhance analytical skills in handling and analyzing temporal data, and critically evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of different modeling strategies when applied to the NDVI dataset.
